# Let's Get Critical

A replacement for CritLine.

The point of this add-on is to keep tabs on your damage records and
play sounds that make me smile when I crit.  Hot damn.  ðŸ”¥

## Current Restrictions


* Tested on Classic (up to and including Catacylsm) and Season of Discovery.
* I play casters, so the focus is on spell damage.

## Installing

Unzip in `Interface/Addons/LetsGetCritical` and reload your UI (`/reload`).

## Moving the Window

You can move the LetsGetCritical window around by clicking the middle button
while the window is under your cursor.

## Commands

`/lgc stats`

Display your current damage stats.

`/lgc clear`

Clear your current character's damage stats.  **WARNING**:  You won't be
asked "Are you sure?" before the stats are cleared.  Then again, you can run 
out and kill stuff to repopulate your records.

`/lgc window off`

Turn off the window.

`/lgc window on`

Turn on the window.

To move the window click and hold the middle mouse button.

`/lgc sounds off`

`/lgc clips`

Open a window for selecting the sound clip that plays for each event.
